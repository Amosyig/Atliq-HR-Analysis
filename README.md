## Introduction
I designed a Power BI dashboard to streamline the organization and tracking of employee presence data. This dashboard enables efficient monitoring, making it easier to interpret attendance patterns and trends. As a result, it saves time and resources, allowing management to focus on strategic decision-making and operational improvements.



## Problem statement
This report addresses the following business questions:

1. What is the percentage of employees present (In-office) on a given day, week, or month?
2. What is the percentage of employees working from home on a given day, week, or month?
3. What is the percentage of employees on sick leave on a given day, week, or month?

## Analysis
From April to June, In-Office attendance at Atliq Hardware has gradually declined, with notable drops on certain days likely due to regional holidays or other factors. Tuesday has the highest in-office attendance at 93%, while Friday has the lowest at 90%. The work-from-home trend during the same period shows variability, ranging from 3.95% on April 5th to 23% on May 11th, with a gradual increase in remote work, particularly on Fridays (13.8%). Sick leave has also risen, peaking at 5% on May 23rd, suggesting a potential spread of illness. Monday has the highest sick leave rate at 1.5%, while Friday has the lowest at 0.69%. Overall, the data indicates changing work patterns, with increasing remote work and sick leave affecting in-office attendance.



## Conclusion and Recommendations:

Based on the observations, the key takeaways are:

1. Monitor Sick Leave Closely: It is crucial to closely track the percentage of sick leave to avoid unexpected drops in productivity due to sudden spikes in employee illness.

2. Analyze Productivity Differences: Gathering additional data on productivity levels when employees work from home versus in the office can help determine if incentives are needed to encourage in-office attendance.

3. Track Presence Data Continuously: Ongoing monitoring of presence data throughout the year and into the next can help identify any seasonal trends, allowing for better anticipation and planning.
